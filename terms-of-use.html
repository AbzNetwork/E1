Risk notice, acknowledgement and acceptance<br></strong></h2><ul role="list" class="list-9"><li><div class="t-20">You hereby acknowledge that you have carefully assessed your financial situation and risk tolerance, and as a consequence, you have conducted any additional research, or asked advice, as you may have deemed necessary after reading the foregoing Disclaimer. You agree to assume responsibility for any of the risks listed in this Section 7 and any other risks, assumptions and decisions involved in Trading of Cryptocurrencies. In the event that you are a Swiss User, you warrant and accept that you understand these risks. You agree to use the Services, YAP's, Applicable Digital Assets, and Personal Addresses at your sole risk and to hold Midas, its licensors and service providers, its directors, consultants or employees free from any claim with respect to risks listed in the Terms of Use.</div></li><li><div class="t-20">Market risk of digital assets. Market risk is a very pronounced risk factor in digital assets. You hereby agree that you understand, assume, acknowledge and accept your exposure to all of the below listed Market risks of digital assets, including Applicable Digital Assets:</div></li><li><div class="t-20">Difficult fair value determination. It can be difficult to determine the fair value of a digital asset prior to the investment. For example, when buying shares in a company, certain models can be used for assessing the fair value. Digital assets are often different in terms of their capital structure which makes it difficult to apply traditional valuation models. Furthermore, Applicable Digital Assets do not represent ownership, but instead confer digital access rights to a service or application. In this case, it can be difficult to assess the value of the purchased Applicable Digital Assets against the value of the service that the digital asset can be used to pay with. This implies the risk of paying more for the digital asset than it might be worth, i.e using the Swap feature on the Platform.</div></li><li><div class="t-20">High volatility. The market value of digital assets is often volatile. Some of the reasons for the volatility are the small market capitalisation compared to traditional capital markets, the risk of sudden regulatory changes, trend-cycles or the performance of the market for traditional investments.</div></li><li><div class="t-20">Emerging market. The market for digital assets, including markets for DeFi and Staking, is still in an emerging and maturing phase. Investment in these markets are often deemed riskier than in long standing and more mature markets. The market for certain Applicable Digital Assets may be yet to exist. Hence you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate or redeem your Applicable Digital Assets.</div></li><li><div class="t-20">Regulatory risks. The legal framework surrounding digital assets is still uncertain in many countries and so far, digital assets have seen to be regulated differently across countries. This non-uniform treatment and new, potential legal measures exposes Applicable Digital Assets and our Users to the risks of non-compliance with law, risks of change in the methodology of Applicable Digital Assets and transactions with such assets being classified differently leading to delisting of an Applicable Digital asset by an exchange, DeFi or Midas, and restricted trade- and transferability which ultimately affect the value of the Applicable Digital Assets and can lead to penalties or fines.</div></li><li><div class="t-20">Enforceability of Smart contracts. A smart contract is an interactive blockchain-native agreement based on code (the "Smart contract"). The interaction of Users with the Services is mostly performed via Smart contracts.</div></li><li><div class="t-20">Market abuse. As outlined above, the market for digital assets is still emerging and subject to a varying or non-existing regulation. As such, not all market participants, including the Issue offer the safeguards of traditional markets to prevent market abuse (i.e. fraud, market manipulation or insider trading). Such market abuse may lead to depreciation of the market value of Applicable Digital Assets and cryptocurrencies resulting in partial or total loss of your cryptocurrency funds and Applicable Digital Assets.</div></li><li><div class="t-20">Market risk is constant. Digital asset exchanges, whether centralised or decentralised, are often open around the clock seven days a week. This means that the digital assets, including Applicable Digital Assets, are subject to a constant market risk as trading never halts.</div></li><li><div class="t-20">Credit and Liquidity risks. Credit and Liquidity risks are often connected to difficulties with the determination of, and assigning the liabilities to the Issuer of an Applicable Digital asset (the "Issuer"), including for purposes of an Applicable Digital asset redemption, either by redeeming it directly for cash with the Issuer or by selling it to a Third-Party, and including with the determination of, and assigning the liabilities to the Issuer by Midas, hence making it illiquid and lack of legal supervision of the Issuers. You hereby agree that you understand, assume, acknowledge and accept your exposure to all of the above mentioned Credit and Liquidity risks.</div></li><li><div class="t-20">Counterparty risk. As mentioned above in Section 3.2 Acceptance of the Fireblocks' terms of use, Fireblocks and not Midas.Investments is responsible for procurement and provision of Fireblocks services, which we heavily rely upon in making the Services accessible and secure. There are variety of risks coming with such reliance, including without limitation, liquidation of Fireblocks' business or default of the Fireblocks on their contractual obligations leading to inaccessibility of, or inability to use, the Services, Staking, YAP's, DeFi and Personal addresses with or without Applicable Digital Assets to Users, including total loss of User cryptocurrency funds. Although Fireblocks is a trusted custody and technologic infrastructure provider and we will strive to do what is in our absolute powers to prevent such occasions from happening, such risks may lead to total and non-refundable loss of your cryptocurrency funds, see also Sections 7.4 (b) and 7.5 (e) below. You hereby agree that you understand, assume, acknowledge and accept your exposure to all of the above mentioned Counterparty risks.</div></li><li><div class="t-20">Technical risks. The technological design of the Networks, Applicable Digital Assets, DeFi and Staking comes with a variety of different risks, including, without limitation those listed below. You hereby agree that you understand, assume, acknowledge and accept your exposure to all of the below listed Technical risks:</div></li><li><div class="t-20">Hardfork. A Hardfork describes an event which splits a new blockchain from the original one by modifying the source code. Usually a modification or update of the source code is accepted by all participants. Where there is a disagreement between such participants of a single network, the network infrastructure can be divided into two groups using two different blockchains. Particularly, in case of Hardfork of any of the Networks, Applicable Digital Assets registered on the Network may be both credited on both the original Network and new network. In the event of a Hardfork, there may be significant price fluctuations resulting in a temporary suspension of Trading of Cryptocurrencies by Midas and loss of access to digital assets, including Applicable Digital Assets.</div></li><li><div class="t-20">Storage of digital assets. Access to the blockchain networks is generally maintained through a public and a private key to an address (the "Keys"). Access to the blockchain network and therefore to the digital asset is impossible if the Keys are lost. Particularly, in our case, such Keys are stored by Fireblocks providing us with custody services in respect of the Applicable Digital Assets. Theft, loss, or destruction of the Keys, as well as hacking of Fireblocks underlying software and technology infrastructure, or other reasons for the private keys stored by Fireblocks to become not recognisable any more can result in you not being able to access and/or use the Applicable Digital Assets on your Personal address.</div></li><li><div class="t-20">Transactional risk. Transactions on any of the Networks available on the Platform are sent to an address determined by the public key and Network choice. If a wrong public key and/or Network is used, it will be impossible to identify the recipient and to reverse the transaction made to an address with a wrong public key or using wrong Network leading to the total loss of control over transacted cryptocurrency and/or Applicable Digital Assets used in such transaction. There may also be delays in the execution of transactions as the transfer of Applicable Digital Assets may become subject to verification, legal suits, actions and proceedings, as well as other processes involving Third-Parties.</div></li><li><div class="t-20">Open source software. Digital Assets are based on open-source software (i.e. Networks) that is freely accessible and may be copied, used or modified at any time. There is thus an increased risk of bugs and vulnerabilities, and also deliberately embedded malfunctions. The discontinuation of such open-source software is always possible and might expose digital assets, including Applicable Digital Assets, to vulnerabilities, programming errors and threats from fraud, theft and attacks, as well as lead to inaccessibility of Personal Addresses and digital assets, including Applicable Digital Assets stored on such Personal Addresses.</div></li><li><div class="t-20">Bugs in smart contracts. Smart contracts, including without limitation those created by Midas and those created by our licensors and service providers can be faulty, vulnerable and/or bugged. For example, in a Swap feature, funds can be exchanged without the need of a middleman/intermediary other than the autonomous smart contract. However, since the smart contract relies solely on the underlying code, the interaction with the smart contract cannot be ensured to be bug-free until we, our licensors or service providers have them audited by a Third-Party professional technical audit company. For the User, this means that the Counterparty risk is the risk of the underlying code of the smart contract which can be difficult to assess. Furthermore, transactions to the smart contract cannot be reversed or rectified even if proven to be faulty.</div></li><li><div class="t-20">Hacking. A decentralised consensus is necessary to validate transactions and the validation requires computing capacity. Therefore, it is possible for a participant with significant computing capacity to effectively centralise the consensus and hence manipulate it. For example, making it possible to verify or process a false transaction for its own benefit at the loss of others. The risk of such a majority attack decreases with the increased computing capacity dedicated to validating. Due to the mathematical foundation of the crypto technology, there are also various other forms of attacks, like collision attacks, dusting attacks, Sybil attacks, denial-of-service attacks and distributed denial-of-service attacks, or censorship attacks.</div></li></ul></div><div class="w-container"><h2><strong>8.
